**Creating a new gaming genre: Where Hearthstone meets tactical grid combat**

---

## 📋 Project Documentation

This project has **two separate visions** with different purposes:

### 🎮 [MVP-GDD.md](./MVP-GDD.md) - Development Document
**Purpose**: Immediate development roadmap
- **Scope**: 4x4 grid, 3 units, local multiplayer
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks (80 hours)
- **Goal**: Prove the concept with minimal features
- **Audience**: Development team
- **Success**: "Holy Shit" moment in 5 minutes

### 🚀 [MASTER-VISION.md](./MASTER-VISION.md) - Pitch Document
**Purpose**: Complete long-term vision
- **Scope**: Full genre-defining game with esports scene
- **Timeline**: 3 years to market leadership
- **Goal**: $150M+ revenue, 10M+ players
- **Audience**: Investors, publishers, marketing
- **Success**: Genre creation and cultural impact

## 🎯 The Core Innovation

**"Tactical Card Battler"** - A completely new gaming genre that combines:

1. **Hearthstone DNA**: Deck building, mana curve, card collection
2. **Grid Combat**: Tactical movement and positioning
3. **Battle Chess**: Visual combat animations on the board
4. **Fire Emblem**: Unit stats, weapon triangle, support bonuses

---

## 🎮 How It Works

### Traditional Card Games:
```
Play Card → Immediate Effect → Done
```

### Tactical Card Battler:
```
Play Card → Unit Spawns on Grid → Move Tactically → Combat with Animations
```

**The result**: Every card play creates persistent tactical assets that must be positioned and used strategically over multiple turns.

## 🚀 Development Strategy

### Phase 1: MVP (Current)
- Prove the concept works
- Validate "Holy Shit" moment
- Learn from player feedback
- **Files**: MVP-GDD.md

### Phase 2: Full Development
- Build towards complete vision
- Scale based on MVP learnings
- Execute long-term roadmap
- **Files**: MASTER-VISION.md

---

## 🎯 Why This Will Work

### Market Opportunity
- **Digital Card Games**: $2.5B market (Hearthstone dominance)
- **Turn-Based Strategy**: $1.8B market (XCOM, Total War)
- **Mobile Strategy**: $4.2B market (Clash Royale)
- **Combined Market**: $8.5B+ with no current leader

### Competitive Advantage
- **First-Mover**: No true "Tactical Card Battler" exists
- **Cross-Appeal**: Attracts card game AND strategy audiences
- **Proven Mechanics**: Each component has been successful separately
- **Scalable Platform**: Web → Mobile → Console → Esports

### Inspiration from Hearthstone
- Started as 2-person Flash prototype
- Minimal MVP with 2 classes only
- Proved concept before scaling
- Now: $1B+ franchise
